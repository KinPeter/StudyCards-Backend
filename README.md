# StudyCards Backend

Backend for my StudyCards web application, an app which I'll use to study vocabulary.
This application is for my private use only, therefore I did not aim for too complex functionality regarding the backend. Basic JWT authentication and simple CRUD operations are available.

##Technologies used:
- Nest JS framework
- TypeScript
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- JWT Passport
- Swagger UI

The Nuxt/Vue frontend app repo can be found [here](https://github.com/KinPeter/StudyCards).

## API documentation
Swagger UI documentation can be accessed on the `/api` route.

## NPM scripts
* Start with dev server: `npm run start:dev`
* Start locally: `npm run start:nest`
* Start in production: `npm start`
* Build: `npm run build`
